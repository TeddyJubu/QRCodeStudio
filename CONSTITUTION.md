# QRCodeStudio Constitution

## Preamble

This constitution establishes the fundamental principles and standards governing the development, maintenance, and evolution of QRCodeStudio. These guidelines ensure consistent code quality, reliable testing, exceptional user experience, and optimal performance across the entire application.

## I. Code Quality Principles

### 1.1 Code Structure & Organization
- **Component Architecture**: All components must be functional React components using hooks
- **File Organization**: Maintain clear separation between UI components, business logic, and data layers
- **Import Standards**: Use established path aliases (`@/*` for client/src, `@shared/*` for shared code)
- **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript's strict mode with explicit type definitions

### 1.2 Code Style & Formatting
- **Consistent Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions and variables
- **Component Structure**: Follow established patterns from existing components
- **Import Organization**: Group imports logically: third-party, shared, local
- **Code Clarity**: Write self-documenting code with clear, descriptive names

### 1.3 Error Handling & Resilience
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: All async operations must include try-catch blocks
- **User Feedback**: Provide clear, actionable error messages to users
- **Graceful Degradation**: Implement fallbacks for failed operations
- **Error Logging**: Log errors appropriately for debugging while avoiding sensitive data exposure

## II. Testing Standards

### 2.1 Testing Philosophy
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing new features when possible
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for minimum 80% test coverage across all modules
- **Testing Pyramid**: Prioritize unit tests, supplement with integration and E2E tests

### 2.2 Unit Testing Requirements
- **Component Testing**: Test all React components for rendering, user interactions, and state changes
- **Utility Testing**: Test all utility functions and helper methods
- **API Testing**: Mock and test all API client functions
- **Hook Testing**: Test custom hooks for various states and edge cases

### 2.3 Integration & E2E Testing
- **User Flows**: Test complete user journeys from QR generation to download
- **API Integration**: Test server-client communication and data flow
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensure functionality across major browsers
- **Responsive Testing**: Verify all functionality on mobile, tablet, and desktop

### 2.4 Testing Best Practices
- **Test Organization**: Structure tests to mirror source code organization
- **Descriptive Test Names**: Use clear, action-oriented test descriptions
- **Mocking Strategy**: Mock external dependencies appropriately
- **Test Data Management**: Use consistent, realistic test data

## III. User Experience Consistency

### 3.1 Design System Adherence
- **Component Library**: Use shadcn/ui components consistently across the application
- **Color System**: Follow established color palette for light and dark modes
- **Typography**: Maintain consistent font hierarchy and spacing
- **Interactive Elements**: Ensure consistent button styles, form controls, and feedback

### 3.2 Interaction Patterns
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provide immediate visual feedback for all user actions
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Use collapsible sections for advanced options
- **Form Validation**: Implement inline validation with helpful error messages
- **Loading States**: Show appropriate loading indicators during async operations

### 3.3 Accessibility Standards
- **WCAG Compliance**: Ensure all components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Support full keyboard navigation throughout the application
- **Screen Reader Support**: Provide proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Color Contrast**: Maintain sufficient contrast ratios for text and interactive elements

### 3.4 Responsive Design
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Design for mobile devices first, then scale up
- **Breakpoint Strategy**: Use consistent breakpoints across all components
- **Touch Targets**: Ensure all interactive elements have adequate touch target sizes
- **Layout Adaptation**: Components must adapt gracefully to different screen sizes

## IV. Performance Requirements

### 4.1 Application Performance
- **Load Time**: Initial application load must complete within 3 seconds on standard connections
- **Bundle Size**: Keep JavaScript bundle under 1MB for optimal performance
- **Runtime Performance**: UI interactions must respond within 100ms
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor and optimize memory usage, especially for long sessions

### 4.2 QR Code Generation Performance
- **Generation Speed**: QR codes must generate within 500ms for standard content
- **Real-time Updates**: Preview updates must be smooth and responsive during typing
- **Large Content Handling**: Optimize for QR codes containing large amounts of data
- **Image Processing**: Logo upload and processing must complete within 2 seconds

### 4.3 Network Performance
- **API Response Time**: All API calls must complete within 1 second
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement appropriate caching for frequently accessed data
- **Offline Capability**: Consider offline functionality for core features
- **Data Transfer**: Minimize data transfer between client and server

### 4.4 Optimization Strategies
- **Code Splitting**: Implement route-based and component-based code splitting
- **Lazy Loading**: Load non-critical components and resources on demand
- **Image Optimization**: Compress and optimize all images, including QR code exports
- **Bundle Analysis**: Regularly analyze and optimize bundle composition

## V. Development Workflow Standards

### 5.1 Code Review Process
- **Peer Review**: All code changes must undergo peer review before merging
- **Automated Checks**: All automated checks (type checking, linting, tests) must pass
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation for all significant changes
- **Performance Impact**: Assess performance implications of all changes

### 5.2 Version Control Practices
- **Commit Standards**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages following conventional commits
- **Branch Strategy**: Maintain clean branch structure with feature branches
- **Merge Requirements**: Ensure main branch is always in a deployable state
- **Tagging**: Use semantic versioning for releases

### 5.3 Continuous Integration
- **Automated Testing**: Run full test suite on all pull requests
- **Type Checking**: Enforce TypeScript strict mode compliance
- **Build Verification**: Ensure successful build for all changes
- **Security Scanning**: Regular security vulnerability scanning

## VI. Maintenance & Evolution

### 6.1 Technical Debt Management
- **Regular Refactoring**: Schedule regular refactoring sessions to address technical debt
- **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies up to date with security patches
- **Code Quality Metrics**: Monitor and improve code quality metrics over time
