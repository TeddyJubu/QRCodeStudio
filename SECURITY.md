# Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security practices and guidelines for the QRCodeStudio project.

## Secret Management

### GitHub Secrets

All sensitive information must be stored as GitHub repository secrets, not in the codebase. Currently used secrets:

- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - For Codecov coverage reporting
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK` - For deployment notifications to Slack
- `SNYK_TOKEN` - For Snyk security vulnerability scanning

### Environment Variables

- Never commit `.env` files to the repository
- Use `.env.example` as a template for required environment variables
- All environment files are included in `.gitignore`

### Secret Detection

The project includes automated secret detection in pre-commit hooks:

- Scans staged files for common secret patterns
- Blocks commits if potential secrets are detected
- Can be bypassed with `git commit --no-verify` (use with caution)

## Secure Development Practices

### Code Security

- All user input must be validated and sanitized
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Regular security audits and dependency updates

### API Security

- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Validate all incoming requests
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

### Database Security

- Use connection pooling and proper connection management
- Implement proper database user permissions
- Regular database backups and security updates

## Security Tools

### Automated Security Checks

- **Snyk**: Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- **npm audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **ESLint**: Code security linting rules
- **Secret detection**: Pre-commit hooks for secret detection

### Manual Security Reviews

- Code reviews must include security considerations
- Regular security audits of the codebase
- Penetration testing before major releases

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it immediately:

1. Create a private issue with the "Security" label
2. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue
4. Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly

### Incident Response Steps

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate the severity and impact of the vulnerability
2. **Containment**: Take immediate steps to limit the impact
3. **Remediation**: Fix the vulnerability and test the fix
4. **Deployment**: Deploy the fix to production
5. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders and users if necessary
6. **Documentation**: Document the incident and lessons learned
