# Implementation Plan: Setup Development Environment

**Branch**: `001-setup-development-environment` | **Date**: September 26, 2025 | **Spec**: `/specs/001-setup-development-environment/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-setup-development-environment/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Setup comprehensive development environment including testing framework, linting configuration, CI/CD pipeline, and development tools to ensure code quality and automate deployment processes for the QRCodeStudio web application.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.6.3, React 18.3.1  
**Primary Dependencies**: Vite 5.4.19, Express 4.21.2, Drizzle ORM 0.39.1, shadcn/ui components  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless, session storage with connect-pg-simple  
**Testing**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION - Testing framework not yet established  
**Target Platform**: Web application (browser), Node.js server  
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)  
**Performance Goals**: <3s load time, <1MB bundle, <100ms UI response, <500ms QR generation  
**Constraints**: TypeScript strict mode, 80%+ test coverage, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-page application with REST API, ~50 components, moderate user base

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

### Code Quality Principles

- [x] **Component Architecture**: Functional React components with hooks - EXISTING
- [x] **File Organization**: Clear separation between UI, business logic, data layers - EXISTING
- [x] **Import Standards**: Path aliases `@/*` and `@shared/*` established - EXISTING
- [x] **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode enabled - EXISTING
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks needed - TO IMPLEMENT
- [ ] **Code Style**: Consistent linting and formatting needed - TO IMPLEMENT

### Testing Standards

- [ ] **Testing Framework**: No testing framework established - NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: 80%+ coverage requirement not enforced - NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION
- [ ] **Unit Testing**: Component, utility, API, hook testing needed - TO IMPLEMENT
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: User flows, API communication testing needed - TO IMPLEMENT
- [ ] **E2E Testing**: Cross-browser, responsive testing needed - TO IMPLEMENT

### User Experience Consistency

- [x] **Design System**: shadcn/ui components in use - EXISTING
- [x] **Color System**: Established color palette for light/dark modes - EXISTING
- [x] **Typography**: Consistent font hierarchy and spacing - EXISTING
- [ ] **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification needed - TO IMPLEMENT
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach implementation needed - TO IMPLEMENT

### Performance Requirements

- [x] **Load Time**: <3s target established - EXISTING
- [x] **Bundle Size**: <1MB limit established - EXISTING
- [x] **Response Time**: <100ms UI response target - EXISTING
- [x] **QR Generation**: <500ms generation target - EXISTING
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Actual performance tracking needed - TO IMPLEMENT
- [ ] **Optimization**: Code splitting, lazy loading needed - TO IMPLEMENT

**Constitution Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Some standards exist, testing framework missing, performance monitoring needed

**Structure Decision**: Web application with separated frontend (client/) and backend (server/) directories, following the existing project structure. Tests and CI/CD workflows to be added as part of this feature.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh opencode`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |

## Progress Tracking

_This checklist is updated during execution flow_

**Phase Status**:

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [x] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
