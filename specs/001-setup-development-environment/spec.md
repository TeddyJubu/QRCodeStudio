# Feature Specification: Setup Development Environment

**Feature Branch**: `001-setup-development-environment`  
**Created**: September 26, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Setup development environment with testing framework, linting, and CI/CD pipeline"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer, I want to set up a complete development environment with testing, linting, and CI/CD so that I can develop high-quality code with confidence and automate deployment processes.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a fresh clone of the repository, **When** I run setup commands, **Then** all development tools are installed and configured
2. **Given** the development environment is set up, **When** I run tests, **Then** all tests pass and coverage is reported
3. **Given** code changes are made, **When** I commit code, **Then** linting and type checking run automatically
4. **Given** a pull request is created, **When** CI pipeline runs, **Then** all checks pass before merge

### Edge Cases

- What happens when required tools are not available on the system?
- How does system handle conflicting tool versions?
- What happens when network connectivity is lost during setup?

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26

- Q: What security considerations should be applied to the CI/CD pipeline for authentication, secrets management, and access control? → A: Self-hosted CI/CD with environment-specific secrets management
- Q: What external services and versioning assumptions should be documented for the development environment setup? → A: GitHub Actions, Node.js 18+, npm 9+, PostgreSQL 15+
- Q: What should be explicitly declared as out-of-scope for this development environment setup feature? → A: Production deployment, monitoring, and infrastructure provisioning
- Q: What performance targets should be set for test execution and CI/CD pipeline runs? → A: No specific performance targets - focus on correctness over speed
- Q: What constitutes measurable Definition of Done for this development environment setup feature? → A: All tests pass, linting clean, CI pipeline green, documentation complete

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST install and configure testing framework with minimum 80% coverage requirement
- **FR-002**: System MUST set up linting with consistent code style enforcement
- **FR-003**: System MUST configure TypeScript strict mode compliance checking
- **FR-004**: System MUST establish CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide pre-commit hooks for code quality checks
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate test coverage reports and documentation
- **FR-007**: System MUST configure development environment with hot reload capabilities

### Out of Scope

- Production deployment automation and infrastructure provisioning
- Application monitoring and observability setup
- Production database configuration and management
- Production security hardening and compliance measures

### Definition of Done

- All automated tests pass with minimum 80% coverage
- Code linting and TypeScript type checking produce zero errors
- CI/CD pipeline executes successfully and passes all quality gates
- Development setup documentation is complete and verified
- Pre-commit hooks are functional and enforce code quality standards

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: CI/CD pipeline MUST use self-hosted infrastructure with environment-specific secrets management for authentication and access control
- **NFR-002**: Development environment MUST support GitHub Actions, Node.js 18+, npm 9+, and PostgreSQL 15+ as external service dependencies
- **NFR-003**: No specific performance targets for test execution - correctness prioritized over speed

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Test Suite**: Collection of unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build, test, and deployment workflows
- **Code Quality Tools**: Linting, formatting, and type checking configurations
- **Development Environment**: Local setup with all necessary tools and dependencies
