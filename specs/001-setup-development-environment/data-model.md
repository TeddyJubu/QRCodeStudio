## Relationships

### TestSuite Relationships
- `TestSuite` 1:* `TestResult` - Each test suite has multiple test results
- `TestSuite` *:1 `CodeQualityTool` - Test suites use various code quality tools
- `TestSuite` *:1 `CIWorkflow` - Test suites are executed in CI workflows

### CodeQualityTool Relationships
- `CodeQualityTool` *:1 `DevelopmentEnvironment` - Tools are configured for specific environments
- `CodeQualityTool` 1:* `Rule` - Each tool has multiple configuration rules

### CIWorkflow Relationships
- `CIWorkflow` 1:* `Job` - Each workflow has multiple jobs
- `CIWorkflow` *:1 `DevelopmentEnvironment` - Workflows target specific environments
- `CIWorkflow` 1:* `PerformanceMetric` - Workflows track various performance metrics

### PerformanceMetric Relationships
- `PerformanceMetric` 1:* `Measurement` - Each metric has multiple measurements over time
- `PerformanceMetric` *:1 `CIWorkflow` - Metrics are tracked in specific workflows

## State Transitions

### TestSuite State Transitions
```
pending → running → (passing | failing)
passing → running → (passing | failing)
failing → running → (passing | failing)
```

### CIWorkflow State Transitions
```
inactive → active → (completed | failed)
completed → active → (completed | failed)
failed → active → (completed | failed)
```

### DevelopmentEnvironment State Transitions
```
setup → configured → (ready | error)
ready → configured → (ready | error)
error → configured → (ready | error)
```

## Data Flow

### Test Execution Flow
1. Code changes trigger test suite execution
2. Test suite runs all configured tests
3. Results are collected and stored
4. Coverage reports are generated
5. Results are reported to CI system

### Code Quality Flow
1. Code is staged for commit
2. Pre-commit hooks trigger code quality tools
3. Tools analyze code against configured rules
4. Issues are reported and must be resolved
5. Clean code is committed to repository

### CI/CD Flow
1. Code is pushed or PR is created
2. CI workflow is triggered
3. Build process creates application artifacts
4. Tests are executed across all suites
5. Performance metrics are collected
6. Results determine workflow success/failure
7. Artifacts are deployed on success
