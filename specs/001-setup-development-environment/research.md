# Phase 0: Research Findings

## Testing Framework Research

### Decision: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright
**Rationale**: 
- Vitest provides fast unit testing with native TypeScript support and Jest-compatible API
- React Testing Library is the de facto standard for testing React components with user-centric approach
- Playwright offers modern E2E testing with cross-browser support and excellent debugging tools
- All three tools integrate seamlessly with Vite and modern React ecosystem

**Alternatives considered**:
- Jest + React Testing Library: Jest is slower and requires more configuration for Vite projects
- Cypress: More expensive license, heavier resource usage compared to Playwright
- Mocha: Requires more setup and configuration compared to Vitest

## Linting and Code Quality Research

### Decision: ESLint + Prettier + Husky
**Rationale**:
- ESLint provides comprehensive JavaScript/TypeScript linting with React-specific rules
- Prettier ensures consistent code formatting across the team
- Husky enables pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality before commits
- This combination is widely adopted and well-documented in the React ecosystem

**Alternatives considered**:
- Biome: Newer and faster but less mature plugin ecosystem
- StandardJS: Less configurable, doesn't fit TypeScript strict mode requirements
- XO: Opinionated but less flexible for complex projects

## CI/CD Pipeline Research

### Decision: GitHub Actions
**Rationale**:
- Native integration with GitHub repository
- Free for public repositories with generous limits for private repos
- Extensive marketplace actions for common tasks
- Excellent support for Node.js, TypeScript, and React projects

**Workflow Components**:
- **Test Workflow**: Run all tests on every push/PR
- **Build Workflow**: Build and validate production artifacts
- **Deploy Workflow**: Deploy to production on main branch merge

**Alternatives considered**:
- GitLab CI: Requires GitLab hosting, less GitHub integration
- CircleCI: More expensive for larger teams
- Jenkins: Self-hosted, more maintenance overhead

## Pre-commit Hooks Research

### Decision: lint-staged + commitlint
**Rationale**:
- lint-staged runs linters only on staged files for performance
- commitlint enforces conventional commit messages for better changelog generation
- Integrates seamlessly with Husky for Git hooks
- Prevents committing code that doesn't meet quality standards

**Configuration**:
- ESLint and Prettier on all staged files
- TypeScript type checking before commit
- Conventional commit message validation

## Performance Monitoring Research

### Decision: Web Vitals + Lighthouse CI
**Rationale**:
- Web Vitals provides real user performance metrics in production
- Lighthouse CI automates performance auditing in CI/CD pipeline
- Both tools integrate well with React and modern web applications
- Provides actionable insights for performance optimization

**Metrics to Track**:
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- First Input Delay (FID)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)

## Code Coverage Research

### Decision: c8 + coverage reports
**Rationale**:
- c8 provides Istanbul-style coverage reporting with native Node.js support
- No additional instrumentation required for TypeScript projects
- Generates comprehensive HTML and text reports
- Integrates with Vitest for seamless coverage collection

**Coverage Targets**:
- 80% minimum overall coverage
- 100% coverage for critical business logic
- 70% minimum for UI components

## Accessibility Testing Research

### Decision: axe-core + jest-axe
**Rationale**:
- axe-core is the industry standard for accessibility testing
- jest-axe integrates accessibility testing with unit tests
- Automated WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checking
- Catches common accessibility issues early in development

**Testing Approach**:
- Unit tests for component accessibility
- Integration tests for user flows
- E2E tests for complete user journeys

## Bundle Analysis Research

### Decision: Rollup Visualizer + Bundlephobia
**Rationale**:
- Rollup Visualizer provides interactive bundle analysis
- Bundlephobia offers dependency size analysis
- Both tools help identify optimization opportunities
- Integrates well with Vite build process

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Code splitting for routes and components
- Tree shaking for unused code
- Lazy loading for non-critical resources
- Dependency optimization and pruning

## Development Environment Research

### Decision: Vite Dev Server + Hot Module Replacement
**Rationale**:
- Vite provides extremely fast development server with native ES modules
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) enables instant feedback during development
- Excellent TypeScript support with no compilation lag
- Rich plugin ecosystem for additional features

**Development Features**:
- Fast refresh for React components
- TypeScript error overlay
- Environment variable management
- Proxy configuration for API calls

## Summary

All research items have been resolved with clear decisions based on:
1. **Ecosystem Integration**: Tools that work well together and with existing stack
2. **Performance**: Fast tools that don't slow down development
3. **Maintainability**: Well-documented, widely-adopted solutions
4. **Scalability**: Tools that can grow with the project
5. **Developer Experience**: Tools that improve rather than hinder productivity

The selected toolchain provides a comprehensive development environment that addresses all constitutional requirements for code quality, testing, user experience, and performance.
